# My Website: [dominicguo.com](dominicguo.com).

## Hi there!
## Hope you've had the chance to check out my website and learn a bit about me.

I created this website as a side-project many years ago to practice the frontend fundamentals of coding with vanilla JS, HTML and CSS. I've uploaded this project to Github in July of 2024.

I come back here and there to tinker a bit and update the contents :)
